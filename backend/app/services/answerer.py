"""Screening-question answerer (T13). Mirrors T12's field_map: a question
resolves via cache → heuristic → LLM classify → cache, then branches on the
matched answer-bank entry:

    verbatim  → fill the bank value as-is, NO LLM
    adaptable → LLM tailors the stored template to this JD + tailored résumé
    fresh     → LLM drafts from the tailored résumé + profile (no bank match)

The classification is cached (stable); the prose is regenerated every call
